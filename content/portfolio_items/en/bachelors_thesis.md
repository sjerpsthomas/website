My bachelor's thesis lasted 10 weeks and consisted of testing chromostereoscopy glasses.
These aren't 'normal' 3D glasses: these glasses bend blue light toward your nose and red light the other way, creating the illusion of depth.
My task was to statistically optimize images for both depth contrast and true-to-life colors.
