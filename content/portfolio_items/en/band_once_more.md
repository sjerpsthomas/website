I play keys in the five-piece band Once More, once described as a 'warm blanket': besides traditional jazz, we also play old Disney songs and some funkier stuff.
In the photo, we just received the 'Popdelft's Got You Covered' award for the best arrangement of Rihanna's 'Umbrella' (we turned it into a bossa nova)!
