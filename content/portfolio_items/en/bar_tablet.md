At my association, drinks are tallied during drinks and paid for later by direct debit (SEPA).
The previous bar tablet app was difficult to use and maintain.
So, in 2024, I created a new app in Jetpack Compose that works better, with a future-proof vision, and integration with our new member administration, accounting, and direct debit workflows (which we also revised).
