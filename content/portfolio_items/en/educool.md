In high school, you sometimes get assignments that you can creatively complete 'in your own way.'
With that in mind, we started the rap duo Educool, where I'm responsible for recording and music production.
We've been around for 10 years and have four albums that are on all streaming services, but I wouldn't listen to them if I were you.
