When you play jazz together, you often do so with 'standards': songs everyone generally knows.
'Real books' are repertoire booklets with popular standards.
My assosiation had created two of them ourselves.
However, the original sources for those booklets had been lost, making correction and adaptation impossible.
After hundreds of hours of importing MusicXML, manual retyping, and formatting alignment, I managed to create one beautiful booklet (with a self-made promotion video!).
