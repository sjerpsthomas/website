A fun Christmas project during my board year!
In the Netherlands, the 'Top 2000' is a national phenomenon where a publically-voted-for list of 2000 songs airs on the radio, starting on Christmas morning, and ending at New Year's exactly.
I wanted to do that for myself.
With the 'Top 2-Jazzend', members could vote by submitting a (Spotify Wrapped) playlist, and a Python script I wrote, using the Spotify API, could merge them into a single list!
