In 2024, my association launched a new website.
The launch was rushed, resulting in subpar code quality and documentation.
In 2024-2025, I aligned many pages more closely with the Figma design, overhauled the search function on one of the pages ('/bands'), and facilitated integration with web forms of our new member administration software.
