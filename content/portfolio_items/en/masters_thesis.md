From November 2024 to July 2025 (30 weeks), I conducted a self-devised research project for my master's thesis.
I implemented and compared various music generation algorithms ('trading fours') using a self-formulated research framework, which included self-assessment of participants, supplemented with third-party assessment, and assessment using statistical techniques.
