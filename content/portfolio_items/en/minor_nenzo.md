The second part of the minor consisted of a larger interactive installation, again in pairs.
The brief: the Koninklijke Bibliotheek (National Library) in The Hague wants to involve more people from the outside world.
The solution: 'Nenzo' consists of a surface with peepholes through which visitors can view news stories.
These stories are brought closer and closer to the visitor (by means of a motor and loop of rope, and increasingly louder ambient music).
I was responsible for, among other things, the motor movement and audio.
