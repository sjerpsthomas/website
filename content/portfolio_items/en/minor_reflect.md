The final and largest part of my minor (10 weeks) was based on the same briefing from the National Library.
In a group of six, we created a video wall that displays information about the library's collections using the silhouettes of passersby (facilitated with a Kinect).
I developed all the software for this project.
The project received a grant for continuation in 2024, though little has happened since then.
The wall remained in the National Library building for a while.
