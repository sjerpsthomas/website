At the end of my second year of my bachelor's degree, I worked in a group of five on a 10-week software project at TEEC2, a company specializing in business process optimization using models.
Based on such a model, we created an application that simulates a person within a company. Multiple applications working together form a company, enabling theoretical stress testing.
I was responsible for the peer-to-peer communication via Nakama.
