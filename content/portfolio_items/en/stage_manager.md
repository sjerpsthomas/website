In 2023 and 2024, I was the stage manager for our association's annual festival, 'Just Jazz.'
As stage manager, I was responsible for my stage's timeline, communication with the bands, and the well-being of the lighting and sound crew during and after set- and instrument changes. In 2023, there were 1000 visitors and I was responsible for the second stage;
in 2024, there were 600 visitors and I was responsible for the main stage.
