If a full band isn't available for an activity or paid gig request, members of my association are sometimes asked individually if they can play an 'occasional gig'.
That's often a lot of fun, so I've done that a few times.
In the photo, it's our Members' Weekend, it's already 2 AM, and I'm preparing for a cantus where everyone will be singing Stevie Wonder at the top of their lungs.
I barely had time to rehearse.
It went well enough.
