Ever since I was a child, I've been interested in creating games.
I started my programming career in GameMaker, and I used it for many hobby projects and game jams until I was 19.
Later, I tried many other frameworks (MonoGame, LWJGL) and then moved on to Godot.
The screenshot is of 'The Pironaut,' which I won a game jam with!
For a university course, I also created a game in Unity in a small group.
